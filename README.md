## Publishing

Execute `yarn release` which will handle following tasks:

- bump package version and git tag
- update/(create if it doesn't exist) CHANGELOG.md
- push to github master branch + push tags
- publish build packages to npm

> releases are handled by awesome [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version)

### Pre-release

- To get from `1.1.2` to `1.1.2-0`:

`yarn release --prerelease`

- **Alpha**: To get from `1.1.2` to `1.1.2-alpha.0`:

`yarn release --prerelease alpha`

- **Beta**: To get from `1.1.2` to `1.1.2-beta.0`:

`yarn release --prerelease beta`

### Dry run mode

See what commands would be run, without committing to git or updating files

`yarn release --dry-run`

### Check what files are gonna be published to npm

- `yarn pack` OR `yarn release:preflight` which will create a tarball with everything that would get published to NPM

## Tests

Test are written and run via Jest ðŸ’ª

```
yarn test
# OR
yarn test:watch
```

## Style guide

Style guides are enforced by robots, I meant prettier and tslint of course ðŸ¤– , so they'll let you know if you screwed something, but most of the time, they'll autofix things for you. Magic right ?

### Style guide npm scripts

```sh
#Format and fix lint errors
yarn ts:style:fix
```

## Generate documentation

`yarn docs`

## Commit ( via commitizen )

- this is preferred way how to create conventional-changelog valid commits
- if you prefer your custom tool we provide a commit hook linter which will error out, it you provide invalid commit message
- if you are in rush and just wanna skip commit message validation just prefix your message with `WIP: something done` ( if you do this please squash your work when you're done with proper commit message so standard-version can create Changelog and bump version of your library appropriately )

`yarn commit` - will invoke [commitizen CLI](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)
